# UN Token

**UN** is the governance and utility token of UNIT. It empowers the global community of contributors to influence and refine the projectâ€™s direction through voting mechanisms. UNIT is governed by selection criteria and index formula algorithms, and these algorithms can be adjusted slightly through proposals made by the community, using the governing token, **UN**.

## **How UNIT Governance Works**

UN holders play a vital role in governing the UNIT ecosystem through the **UNIT DAO**. By using **UN** tokens, they can vote on proposals to shape the development of the platform. Governance is designed to be flexible, allowing for minimal intervention while ensuring that the community can steer the project toward its goals.

There is also a **grace period** built into the governance process, allowing UN holders to **veto an approved proposal** if it is deemed risky for the system. As UNIT evolves, the governance process will be deployed on widely accepted and asset-enabled transactional layers, such as Ethereum.

State-of-the-art governance tools like **Snapshot** or **Tally** are used for voting on proposals, while a governance forum facilitates community discussions. Governing contracts and processes are regularly updated to meet current standards and innovations.

UN resources are outlined in [The UNIT's Resources paper](https://github.com/toknowwhy/the-unit-resources-paper/blob/main/the-unit-resources-paper.pdf) and the [UN Allocation section](un-allocation.md).

## **Types of Decisions in UNIT Governance**

UN holders can propose and vote on a variety of governance decisions regarding the UNIT index and its related smart contracts. These decisions include:

1. **Coin Inclusion in the UNIT Index:**\
   UNIT holders vote to decide whether a new coin should be added to the UNIT index once it passes the established threshold for inclusion.
2. **Algorithm Adjustments (Threshold, Components):**\
   Governance can propose and agree on changes to the algorithm, including thresholds for coin inclusion and the components used to calculate the index.
3. **Data Aggregator Platforms:**\
   Changes to the platforms providing data for the index, including decisions on which data aggregator platforms to use, are subject to governance voting.
4. **Upgrades to UNIT Smart Contracts:**\
   Proposals for technical upgrades or changes to the UNIT smart contracts must be approved by UNIT holders through governance voting and executed by the governance multi-sig.
